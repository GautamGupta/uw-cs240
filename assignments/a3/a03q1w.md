On line 11, we assign a subset of A as the left child of an element from B. This works as `A < B`.

On line 12, we assign the modified B as the right child of the smallest element from B. This works as `smallest element < modified B`.

On line 13, we assign the smallest element as the right child of the parent node from line 11 assignment. This works as `right child (previous right child + B) > parent node`.

On line 14, we fix any imbalances on the parent node.

The complexity of the algorithm is `O(max(A.height, B.height))`.
